## Unity / XR / OS Core Handoff

This repo defines constraints for future Unity work:

Unity must:
- Respect household sovereignty
- Treat PAN-1 as immutable origin
- Never bypass Seat authority
- Mirror, not replace, Lite logic

XR is an extension — not a rewrite.

No Unity system may:
- Invent authority
- Override Presence consent
- Store personal data outside declared scope
